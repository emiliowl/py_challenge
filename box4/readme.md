# Welcome to box 4

I'm sooo happy to see you again!
Things are starting to get funnier... what if we start trying some Monkey Patching (`https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monkey-patching-in-python-dynamic-behavior/`) exercises?

How I wish to have a quickSort function on every MyArray in my path... can you do it?
But you know... I want you to implement it from scracth! Looking forward to see you again!

Kind advice (again): DON'T USE A BUILTIN FUNCTION, this will take you out of the competition.
