# Welcome to box 2

Well, seems like you're good with python enough to create a new project from scratch using pip and adding pytest test lib on it.

Now you will work in a new project, install pip test dependencies (pytest again) and make the code that actually will make tests work fine...

---

## Instructions

Just do the same steps you did before... it's easy! After this, go to test_two and try to figure out how to make it works!

1. To finish this: write the code needed to pass the tests and move to the next box!
